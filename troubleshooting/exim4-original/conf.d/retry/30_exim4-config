### retry/30_exim4-config
#################################

# This single retry rule applies to all domains and all errors. It specifies
# retries every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then increasing retry intervals,
# starting at 1 hour and increasing each time by a factor of 1.5, up to 16
# hours, then retries every 6 hours until 4 days have passed since the first
# failed delivery.

# Please note that these rules only limit the frequency of retries, the
# effective retry-time depends on the frequency of queue-running, too.
# See QUEUEINTERVAL in /etc/default/exim4.
