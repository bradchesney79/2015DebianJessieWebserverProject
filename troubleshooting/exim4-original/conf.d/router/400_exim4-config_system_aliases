### router/400_exim4-config_system_aliases
#################################

# This router handles aliasing using a traditional /etc/aliases file.
#
##### NB  You must ensure that /etc/aliases exists. It used to be the case
##### NB  that every Unix had that file, because it was the Sendmail default.
##### NB  These days, there are systems that don't have it. Your aliases
##### NB  file should at least contain an alias for "postmaster".
#
# This router handles the local part in a case-insensitive way which
# satisfies the RFCs requirement that postmaster be reachable regardless
# of case. If you decide to handle /etc/aliases in a caseful way, you
# need to make arrangements for a caseless postmaster.
#
# Delivery to arbitrary directories, files, and piping to programs in
# /etc/aliases is disabled per default.
# If that is a problem for you, see
#   /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz
# for explanation and some workarounds.
