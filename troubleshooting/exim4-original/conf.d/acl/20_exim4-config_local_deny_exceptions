### acl/20_exim4-config_local_deny_exceptions
#################################

# This is used to determine whitelisted senders and hosts.
# It checks for CONFDIR/host_local_deny_exceptions and
# CONFDIR/sender_local_deny_exceptions.
#
# It is meant to be used from some other acl entry.
#
# See exim4-config_files(5) for details.
#
# If the files do not exist, the white list never matches, which is
# the desired behaviour.
#
# The old file names CONFDIR/local_host_whitelist and
# CONFDIR/local_sender_whitelist will continue to be honored for a
# transition period. Their use is deprecated.

  # This hook allows you to hook in your own ACLs without having to

  # a small performance penalty since there is an additional file being
