#################################

# This router handles e-mail addresses in "domain literal" form like
# <user@[10.11.12.13]>. The RFCs require this facility, but it is disabled
# in the default config since it is seldomly used and frequently abused.
# Domain literal support also needs to be enabled in the main config,
# which is automatically done if you use the enable macro
# MAIN_ALLOW_DOMAIN_LITERALS.

  debug_print = "R: domain_literal for $local_part@$domain"
  driver = ipliteral
