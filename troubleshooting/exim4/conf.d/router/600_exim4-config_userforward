### router/600_exim4-config_userforward
#################################

# This router handles forwarding using traditional .forward files in users'
# home directories. It also allows mail filtering with a forward file
# starting with the string "# Exim filter" or "# Sieve filter".
#
# The no_verify setting means that this router is skipped when Exim is
# verifying addresses. Similarly, no_expn means that this router is skipped if
# Exim is processing an EXPN command.
#
# The check_ancestor option means that if the forward file generates an
# address that is an ancestor of the current one, the current one gets
# passed on instead. This covers the case where A is aliased to B and B
# has a .forward file pointing to A.
#
# The four transports specified at the end are those that are used when
# forwarding generates a direct delivery to a directory, or a file, or to a
# pipe, or sets up an auto-reply, respectively.

    This is an automatically generated message. An error has\n\
    been found in your .forward file. Details of the error are\n\
    reported below. While this error persists, you will receive\n\
    a copy of this message for every message that is addressed\n\
    to you. If your .forward file is a filter file, or if it is\n\
    a non-filter file containing no valid forwarding addresses,\n\
    a copy of each incoming message will be put in your normal\n\
    mailbox. If a non-filter file contains at least one valid\n\
    forwarding address, forwarding to the valid addresses will\n\
    happen, and those will be the only deliveries that occur.
